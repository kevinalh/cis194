# CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)

These is a working space for the [CIS 194 Course on Haskell by Brent Yorgey](www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/).

To run the examples, we can use the [Docker Official Haskell Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/haskell).
The specific command is in the Makefile, which we can invoke with `make run`.
